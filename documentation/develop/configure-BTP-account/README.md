# Configure Your SAP BTP Environment with the Help of Boosters

## Introduction

In this section you will configure an SAP BTP account with all the required entitlements, to develop your low-code application using [Boosters](https://help.sap.com/docs/BTP/65de2977205c403bbc107264b8eccf4b/fb1b56148f834749a2bf51127421610b.html?locale=en-US). You also will create an SAP HANA Cloud instance to store the data needed for your application.

 ### Create SAP HANA Cloud Instance

 > The SAP HANA Cloud instance is the main cost driver of this scenario. To save costs, it's recommended to create the instance shortly before usage. Note that previewing your application is possible without the created SAP HANA Cloud instance and only needed for final deployment of your application.

Now, you need to create an [SAP HANA Cloud](https://help.sap.com/docs/HANA_CLOUD/f4997718ff9d45f49f90f5d01d16d5a0/2f0c5e3dc11d4eb8a1d6cb878a311f43.html?locale=en-US) instance.

1. Navigate back to your **Subaccount** and select your **Space**.

2. In the menu on the left choose section **SAP HANA Cloud**, choose **Create**, and choose _SAP HANA Database_ in the dropdown.

   <img src="././images/hana_1.png" width="70%">

3. Now, you have opened the **SAP HANA Cloud Central** and you can change the **Type** of your instance. Make sure you have selected **SAP HANA Cloud, SAP HANA Database** and choose **Next Step**.

   <img src="././images/hana_2.png" width="70%">

4. Choose a *name* for your instance and choose an **Admin Password** and confirm the password in the corresponding field. Choose **Next Step**.

   <img src="././images/hana_3.png" width="70%">

5. In the next tabs "3. SAP HANA Database" and "4. SAP HANA Database availability Zones and Replicas" leave the default configuration and choose **Next Steps**.

6. In tab "5. SAP HANA Database Advanced Settings" scroll down to **Connections** and select **Allow all IP addresses**. Choose **Review and Create**.

    > For demo purposes, we allow all IP addresses in this mission. If you are implementing this scenario in a productive environment, only allow specific IP addresses.

    <img src="././images/hana_4.png" width="70%">

7. Your SAP HANA instance is now being created.
