If you don't own an SAP S/4HANA system, you could use the 30-day trial version. As a prerequisite you need either an Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud Platform account. For the operation costs, you will be charged by the account provider. You can create an [SAP S/4HANA 2020, Fully Activated Appliance](https://cal.sap.com/catalog#/solutions/7a3ebd3e-d005-4c70-ae35-40a167aed981) by logging on and choosing **Create Instance** on the top right.

To run the mission, you have to activate these components:
