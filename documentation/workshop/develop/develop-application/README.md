   > Loading SAP Business Application Studio for low-code development can take some time, especially if itâ€™s the first time you use it.


### Start Development of Application and Create Data Model

Now you can start the development of your application. First you will model your application and define the database table and the relationship between the entities.

1. In this application two Data Models 'Risks' and 'Mitigations', to hold the data are needed. To create a Data Model open SAP Business Application Studio under tab **Home**, look for the tile **[Data Models](https://help.sap.com/docs/Application%20Development/6a5fc562f6e2402aa84b0416614a05fc/759ecc54523141d1af2b56f7b27c110a.html?locale=en-US)** and choose the **+** icon to add a new entity.

   <img src="./images/add_data_model_1.png" width="30%">

2. Enter the **Entity Name** _Risks_. Retain the property `ID` and choose the **+** icon in the table to add the following properties:

    | Property Name | Property Type | Max Length |
    |---------------|---------------|------------|
    | title         | string        | 100        |
    | prio          | string        | 5          |
    | description   | string        | 100        |
    | impact        | integer       |            |
    | criticality   | integer       |            |
